# Liver_Prediction

This project aims to predict liver disease using various machine learning models. The dataset used for this project contains medical and demographic features of patients, and the goal is to identify individuals at risk of liver diseases.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains records of patients with and without liver disease. Key features include age, gender, bilirubin levels, cholesterol, albumin, and other liver function markers.
